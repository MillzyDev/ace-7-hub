                    <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
                    <p>ACE-7 (otherwise known as the Anomalous Experimentation Division) is a division of the Research department that was founded by Dpt. Director Frederick Mills on the 13th of November 2022.</p>
                    <p>The Anomalous Chemical Experimentation division specialises in the analysis and development of anomalous chemicals, compounds and atomic structures. ACE-7 uses anomalous objects, entities and phenomena to develop and/or study anomalous substances that may be utilised by the Foundation to more efficiently achieve its goals.</p>
                    <p>ACE-7’s primary goal is to expand the basis of knowledge surrounding anomalous chemistry and to make said knowledge easily available. In addition to this, ACE-7 also strives to actively encourage people to learn about anomalous chemistry.</p>

                    <h1>Our Structure</h1>
                    <h2>Principle Investigator (PI)</h2>
                    <p>The Principle Investigator is responsible for all activity within ACE-7. Their role is to ensure the division and, by extension, the Research Department as a whole has access to the information, resources and training needed to conduct anomalous chemical research. This individual is the final decision maker on any issues related to the division.</p>
                    <p>The Principle Investigator is responsible for processing proposals and selecting team members. The PI personally oversees the writing and publishing of documentation and articles to disseminate findings.</p>
                    <h2>Project Coordinator (PC)</h2>
                    <p>A Project Coordinator manages the research and data collection, as directed by the Principle Investigator, of an active project. Project Coordinators are assigned to projects by the Principle Investigator. Their role is also to evaluate active projects and suggest any modifications that may need to be made.</p>
                    <h2>Research Assistant (RA)</h2>
                    <p>Research Assistants perform the day-to-day tasks of the division. This includes but is not limited to: administrative work, data collection, chemical experimentation…etc. Research Assistants report to Project Coordinators and the Principle Investigator.</p>

                            <p>Members of ACE-7 must adhere to the Code of Ethics, Code of Conduct and Research Policy.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Each member will have a performance level. Performance is evaluated every seven (7) days and is affected by activity, participation and conduct. A very low performance level may result in removal from the division.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>If a member of ACE-7’s performance drops below the minimum value, said member will be removed from ACE-7.</p>
